# SLLang
Over the summer, I decided to look into how programming languages work, including the operation of **kernels** and how the interaction between the language and hardware works. 

I decided to undertake the very long project of creating my own programming language from scratch, implementing **lexers, parsers, ASTs, etc.** 

I programmed it in C, in order to improve some of my lower-level programming skills, but I also did it because it is my language of choice. 

Feel free to clone the repository, run the `Makefile`; and use my language... SLLang!
